# Digital Library Management System

This repository contains a **Digital Library Management System** project implemented as part of a Data Structures course. The system uses a variety of data structures to efficiently manage book records, user preferences, and authentication.

---

## Project Overview

The **Digital Library Management System** provides an interactive menu-driven application for managing a library, with features such as:
- Book addition, removal, sorting, and searching.
- User authentication with encrypted credentials.
- Favorites list managed by priority.
- Random and genre-based book suggestions.

### Key Features
1. **Book Management**:
   - Add, remove, search, and sort books by title, genre, or rating.
   - Efficiently handle large book lists using linked lists.

2. **Favorites List**:
   - Add books to a priority queue based on user preferences.
   - Display and manage favorite books.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Register and log in with encrypted credentials stored using hashing.

4. **Book Suggestions**:
   - Random and genre-based book recommendations.

5. **Sorting and Searching**:
   - Sort books using quicksort algorithms for title, genre, and rating.
   - Binary search for efficient title-based searching.

## Data Structures Used
1. **Doubly Linked List**:
   - To store book records for efficient traversal and manipulation.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - To manage the user's favorites list by priority.

3. **Hash Table**:
   - For secure user authentication and credential management.

4. **Quick Sort**:
   - For sorting books by title, genre, or rating.

5. **Binary Search**:
   - For fast and efficient book searching by title.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler installed on your system.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd digital-library-ds
